      "---  In this paper, we revisit the problem of uniqueness for parabolic curvature flows on a smooth manifold _inline_math_. By virtue of their invariance under the action of _inline_math_, such equations are never strictly parabolic, and this basic geometric degeneracy must be overcome or circumvented in some fashion in order to use the methods of standard parabolic theory on this problem. The standard means of circumvention in this situation is the DeTurck trick (_citation_, _citation_) which, as it pertains to uniqueness, is an exchange of one problem for two: the problem of uniqueness for the geometric flow for separate problems of existence and uniqueness for two auxiliary strictly parabolic systems. In the case of the Ricci flow, for example (see _citation_, _citation_), one must verify the short-time existence of a certain harmonic-map-type heat flow to obtain the so-called DeTurck diffeomorphisms, and then verify the uniqueness of the associated solutions to the Ricci-DeTurck flow. \n",
      "---  When, as on compact manifolds, the problems for the auxiliary equations belong to standard parabolic theory, this exchange is purely an advantageous one. (See _citation_, e.g., for a careful treatment of this approach to a class of higher-order equations.) In some settings, however, these auxiliary equations introduce nontrivial questions of their own. In _citation_, for example, en route to proving the uniqueness of solutions to the Ricci flow on noncompact manifolds, the authors must first confront a nonstandard and rather thorny problem of existence for the DeTurck diffeomorphisms. Of course, their approach pays dividends beyond the question of uniqueness, in that it verifies, as a byproduct, the existence of a well-controlled solution to the DeTurck flow associated to any complete solution to the Ricci flow of bounded curvature. \n",
      "---  The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, insofar as it concerns the question of uniqueness, it is possible to overcome the geometric degeneracy of these equations without resorting to DeTurck’s trick or considering any auxiliary parabolic systems. We show that, after reframing the problem as one for a suitably prolonged system, the uniqueness in fact follows from an elementary and essentially classical energy argument, whose proof moreover yields a quantitative (albeit rather coarse) bound on the _inline_math_-norm of the difference of the solutions. In an earlier paper _citation_, we applied a variation of this technique to the particular case of the Ricci flow and a somewhat more general class of second-order systems. (See also the subsequent paper of Bell _citation_ for an application to the conformal Ricci flow.) Here, we generalize this technique to higher-order systems. \n",
      "---  For concreteness, we first consider a class of quasilinear higher-order parabolic equations considered in the recent papers of Bahuaud and Helliwell _citation_, _citation_ and give an alternative proof of the uniqueness result in the latter reference. This class includes the _inline_math_-curvature flow and a family of equations introduced in _citation_, _citation_, _citation_ related to the ambient obstruction tensor. We then formulate a general uniqueness result, and verify its applicability to a further example, the fully-nonlinear cross-curvature flow of Chow and Hamilton _citation_. \n",
      "---  We will restrict our attention below to compact manifolds _inline_math_. Our primary aim is to demonstrate an alternative method of overcoming the geometric degeneracy of these equations, and the demonstration is the most transparent in this simpler case. With suitable estimates on the solutions and the addition of sufficiently rapidly decaying weights, however, this basic technique can be extended to the non-compact setting. In _citation_, for example, we have explored this extension already in the context of the Ricci flow, where we use an energy approach to give an alternative proof of the uniqueness of complete solutions of bounded curvature (_citation_, _citation_) and prove a slight extension to solutions with some spatial growth of curvature. We intend to pursue this extension to other equations in future work. \n",

The short-time existence of solutions to the equation beginning at metrics of positive or negative curvature was verified by Buckland _citation_. \n",
      "---  Here we give a proof of the following uniqueness assertion. \n",
      "---  Let _inline_math_ be a closed manifold. Suppose _inline_math_, _inline_math_ are two solutions to (38) on _inline_math_ with strictly positive or negative sectional curvature and _inline_math_. Then _inline_math_ for all _inline_math_. \n",
      "---  The proof in the positively and negatively curved cases are virtually the same, so we will prove only the case that _inline_math_ has strictly negative curvature. As we have observed, in this case, the Einstein tensors _inline_math_, _inline_math_ of _inline_math_ and _inline_math_ are positive definite. Let _inline_math_ be a constant such that _display_math_ on _inline_math_. (Since the manifold _inline_math_ is compact, the solutions _inline_math_ and _inline_math_ are uniformly equivalent on _inline_math_ for _inline_math_.) \n",
      "---  In view of Theorem 14, it suffices to prove that we can encode the problem of uniqueness into one for a prolonged system of the form (35). This can be done in several different ways. We find it convenient we base the parabolic part (the _inline_math_ component) of the system on the difference of the inverses _inline_math_, _inline_math_ of the Einstein tensors of _inline_math_ and _inline_math_. Thus, we define _display_math_ and introduce the operator _inline_math_. (In general, we take _inline_math_.) These quantities together satisfy a closed system of differential inequalities relative to the norms and connection induced by _inline_math_, which we take, as before, to be our reference metric. \n",
      "---  Under the assumptions of Theorem 15, the tensors _inline_math_, _inline_math_, _inline_math_ satisfy the inequalities for some constant _inline_math_, where _inline_math_ is the _inline_math_-tensor given by _display_math_ and satisfies _inline_math_. \n",
      "---  We prove Proposition 16 in the next section. \n",
      "---  Proposition 16 implies that _inline_math_ and _inline_math_ satisfy where _inline_math_ for some constant _inline_math_. The operator _inline_math_ is strongly elliptic under our assumptions, and _inline_math_ satisfies _display_math_ Hence Theorem 15 follows from Theorem 14. ∎ \n",
      "---  In fact, when formulated in terms of _inline_math_, _inline_math_ and _inline_math_, the uniqueness assertion of Theorem 15 essentially follows from our earlier general theorem in _citation_, modulo the verification of the inequalities in Proposition 16; see Remark 15 in that reference. \n",
      "---  Let _inline_math_ be a solution to (38). The Levi-Civita connection and the tensor _inline_math_ associated to _inline_math_ evolve according to the equations \n",
      "---  Equation (41) follows from the standard formula for the evolution of the connection and (37). Equation (42) follows from some routine calculations from the formula _display_math_ from _citation_, using _inline_math_. ∎ \n",
      "---  Now, the Einstein tensor is divergence-free, i.e., _inline_math_, and so we compute that (cf. the computations on pp. 6-7 of _citation_) where _inline_math_, and _display_math_ Since _inline_math_, we have _inline_math_ for some constant _inline_math_. Returning to (42) and putting things together, we obtain _display_math_ on _inline_math_ as desired. \n",
      "---  The tensor _inline_math_, meanwhile, evolves according to _display_math_ The first term is just _inline_math_, and for the second term, we have _inline_math_ for some _inline_math_ since the Einstein tensors of _inline_math_ and _inline_math_ are uniformly strictly positive on _inline_math_. Thus _display_math_ \n",
      "---  Finally, from (41), we have the schematic equation Now, so expanding the last difference on the right into three terms and estimating them as above, we obtain _display_math_ for some _inline_math_. The proof of Proposition 16 is completed. \n"
