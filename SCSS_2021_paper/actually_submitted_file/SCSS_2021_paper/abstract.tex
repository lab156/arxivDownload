We introduce ArGoT, a data set of mathematical terms extracted from 
the articles hosted on the arXiv website. 
A term is any mathematical concept defined in an article.
Using labels in the article's source code and examples from other
popular math websites, we mine all the terms in the
arXiv data and compile a comprehensive vocabulary of mathematical terms.
Each term can be then organized in a dependency graph by using
the term's definitions and the arXiv's metadata.
Using both hyperbolic and standard word embeddings, we demonstrate how 
this structure is reflected in the text's vector representation and
how they capture relations of entailment in mathematical concepts. This
data set is part of an ongoing effort to align natural mathematical
text with existing Interactive Theorem Prover  Libraries (ITPs) of
formally verified statements.
